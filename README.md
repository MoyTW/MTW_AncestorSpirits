# Summary

![This Shrine is very fancy](https://github.com/MoyTW/MTW_AncestorSpirits/blob/master/About/Preview.png)

You Ancestors are watching you, and they are hard to impress. To ignore them would be foolish, though - they're the foundation of your tribal magic, and if they're displeased are more than capable of calling down storms, plagues, and divine punishments. If, on the other hand, you manage to honor and please your ancestors, they can gift you with Magic, which is the basis for all your Petitions - Petitions which can call rain or lightning, or heal sick or injured tribe members.

![They aren't currently ghostly, but at some point, if I get around to it, they will be. I hate graphics-stuff though.](https://github.com/MoyTW/MTW_AncestorSpirits/blob/master/About/Images/RoomAndAncestorCard.jpg)

Every so often, your Ancestors will drop in to visit! They don't need to eat or sleep, but they do get bored sometimes. Mostly they're here just to see the sights! Ugliness and disorder will anger them, but beautiful and rich surroundings will please them. When your Ancestors return to their Anchor, they will pass judgement on your village. If they're pleased, they will grant you more magic when the season turns. If they're not, you may even lose magic. If they're incredibly displeased you may suffer a curse, so ensure that this does not happen!

The Magic that you accumulate can be spent on Petitions. The amount of magic spent is equal to the number of attached and lit Braziers (those are the buildings on the left/right of the Shrine). You can spend between double and half the listed magic price. The chance of success at half magic is slightly over half, and at double they will for sure grant your petition. Vary your spend depending on urgency, but overall you will probably have better long-term results by using less on more attempts.
